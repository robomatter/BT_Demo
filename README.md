# BT_Demo
Demonstration code that connects an iOS device to ROBOTC running on the VexIQ robot Brain using bluetooth LE.

The accompanying ROBOTC program should be running on the Brain for the demo to function.  A Touch LED should be connected to the brain
on any port.  The Brain needs a Smart Radio installed, it needs to be running V1.16 SmartRadio firmware or later and the ROBOTC Smart Radio
firmware also needs to be installed.

The USB cable must be disconnected from the VexIQ brain for the bluetooth link to work correctly.
